# The-Real-Scoop
Project for HCI class, Mobile Application
All documentation regarding the application can be found as Project 1a,b, Project 2 Contextual Inquiry and Analysis,
Project 3 Requirements and Modeling,Project 4 Design, and Project 5 Prototype respectively. Please note that the actual prototype requires 
a full or free trial version of Mockplus software which typically runs out within 7 days.

While there was a more accessible version, unfortunately it is larger than the 25MB file limit imposed by Github. While this is not a 
full implemented design, it does show click-through capabilities and proof of concept.
Please download the trial version of Mockplus if you'd like to try it out, thank you.
